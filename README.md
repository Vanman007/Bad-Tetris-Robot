Road to making a neural network tetris bot or maybe other learning algorithms its a learning high way just for fun

Very simple and very ugly coded bot. 
It was meant to be fast and minimal code so i could train neural net work on it 
But it ended up being larger and in my atmept to code fast i made it unreadable for human
I would never code like this in a project with others!
